  -This is a website that offers easy access to machine learning models trained on FIFA 20 player data. Fifa 20 is a video game that requires one to be imaginative 
when combining players to build customized teams from real life soccer players. When choosing from thousands of different players, it can be hard to choose the best combination of players to build your team. This website offers the implementation of several basic machine learning models to assist Fifa players in the challenge of building their "Ultimate Team"!

-The models are implemented on the backend in python using Flask. I sourced the data from here: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset

-The front end is a combination of HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap. 

Models: 

  KNN - K Nearest Neighbors model to find similar players to a searched player. I implemented this "model" from scratch. 
  
  Linear Regression -
